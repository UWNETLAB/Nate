# `nlpnet`

**Research at the intersection of natural language processing and social network analysis.**

`nlpnet` (formerly known as `nate`) is a Python package designed and developed by [NETLAB](https://uwaterloo.ca/networks-lab/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). It is designed to facilitate research at the intersection of social network analysis / network science and applied natural language processing. It scales efficiently for large and complex datasets. 

`nlpnet` offers functionality for seamlessly connecting state-of-the-art machine learning models used in natural language processing workflows using [`spacy`](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) with network analysis workflows using packages such as [`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/), [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/python/) for Python, and [`graph-tool`](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/). `nlpnet` has carefully-designed data structures that connect these two types of research workflows, and offers a set of tools for quickly producing descriptive reports and visualizations.
